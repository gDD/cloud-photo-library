# Cloud Photo Library

Cloud Photo Library uploads original photos to Amazon S3, and keep local thumbnails, with metadata attached, so you could retrieve the original photos later.

Benifits:

- It's a good photo backup solution, because Amazon S3 is very safe and secure.
- Suitable for people with a small SSD laptop (→_→ MacBook Air 128GB...).
